# Force no function reordering on a-except.o because of the exclusion bounds
# mechanism (see the source file for more detailed information).
# force debugging information on a-except.o so that it is always
# possible to set conditional breakpoints on exceptions.
# use -O1 otherwise gdb isn't able to get a full backtrace on mips targets.
